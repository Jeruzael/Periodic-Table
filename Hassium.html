			<h1>What is Hassium?</h1>
			<p>Hassium is a chemical element with the symbol Hs and the atomic number 108. It is not known to occur in nature and has been made only in laboratories in minuscule quantities. Hassium is highly radioactive; the most stable known isotope, ²⁶⁹Hs, has a half-life of approximately 16 seconds.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>There are 15 known isotopes of hassium with mass numbers 263 to 277, with isotope-276 having the longest half-life of 1.1 hour. The first attempt to synthesize element 108 took place in 1978 at Russia’s Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, where a team headed by Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir Utyonkov bombarded radium with calcium and got isotope 270. In 1983, they obtained other isotopes: by bombarding bismuth with manganese they got isotope 263, by bombarding californium with neon they got isotope 270, and by bombarding lead with iron they got isotope 264.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Hassium has no known biological role. At present it is only used in research.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Hassium does not occur naturally and it will probably never be isolated in observable quantities. It is created by bombarding lead with iron atoms</p>
