			<h1>What is Rubidium?</h1>
			<p>Rubidium is used in vacuum tubes as a getter, a material that combines with and removes trace gases from vacuum tubes. It is also used in the manufacture of photocells and in special glasses. Since it is easily ionized, it might be used as a propellant in ion engines on spacecraft.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>In 1861, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, of the University of Heidelberg, dissolved the ore in acid and then precipitated the potassium it contained which carried down another heavier alkali metal. By carefully washing this precipitate with boiling water they removed the more soluble potassium component and then confirmed that they really had a new element by examining the atomic spectrum of what remained. This showed two intense ruby red lines never seen before, indicating a new element, which they named after this colour.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Rubidium is little used outside research. It has been used as a component of photocells, to remove traces of oxygen from vacuum tubes and to make special types of glass.

It is easily ionised so was considered for use in ion engines, but was found to be less effective than caesium. It has also been proposed for use as a working fluid for vapour turbines and in thermoelectric generators.

Rubidium nitrate is sometimes used in fireworks to give them a purple colour.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Rubidium occurs in the minerals pollucite, carnallite, leucite and lepidolite. It is recovered commercially from lepidolite as a by-product of lithium extraction. Potassium minerals and brines also contain rubidium and are another commercial source.</p>
