			<h1>What is Meitnerium?</h1>
			<p>It has an atomic number of 109 and an atomic mass of 268 AMU. It is considered a transition metal and is radioactive. Currently, there are no real uses for meitnerium, except in research. In time, meitnerium might be used for technology purposes and harvesting energy.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>There are 7 isotopes of meitnerium with mass numbers in the range 266 to 279. The longest lived is isotope 278 with a half-life of 8 seconds. Meitnerium was first made in 1982 at the German nuclear research facility, the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI), by a group headed by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg. They bombarded a target of bismuth with accelerated iron ions. After a week, a single atom of element 109, isotope 266, was detected. This underwent radioactive decay after 5 milliseconds.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Meitnerium has no known biological role. At present it is only used in research.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Fewer than 10 atoms of meitnerium have ever been made, and it will probably never be isolated in observable quantities. It is made by bombarding bismuth with iron atoms.</p>
