			<h1>What is Iridium?</h1>
			<p>Iridium is a chemical element with the symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is considered to be the second-densest metal with a density of 22.56 g/cm³ as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>Iridium was discovered together with osmium in1803 by Smithson Tennant in London. When crude platinum was dissolved in dilute aqua regia, which is a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, it left behind a black residue thought to be graphite. Tennant thought otherwise, and by treating it alternately with alkalis and acids he was able to separate it into two new elements. These he announced at the Royal Institution in London, naming one iridium, because its salts were so colourful and the other osmium because it had a curious odour (see osmium).</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Iridium is the most corrosion-resistant material known. It is used in special alloys and forms an alloy with osmium, which is used for pen tips and compass bearings. It was used in making the standard metre bar, which is an alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. It is also used for the contacts in spark plugs because of its high melting point and low reactivity.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Iridium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. It is found uncombined in nature in sediments that were deposited by rivers. It is commercially recovered as a by-product of nickel refining.

A very thin layer of iridium exists in the Earth’s crust. It is thought that this was caused by a large meteor or asteroid hitting the Earth. Meteors and asteroids contain higher levels of iridium than the Earth’s crust. The impact would have caused a huge dust cloud depositing the iridium all over the world. Some scientists think that this could be the same meteor or asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs.</p>
