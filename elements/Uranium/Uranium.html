			<h1>What is Uranium?</h1>
			<p>Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. </p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>In the Middle Ages, the mineral pitchblende (uranium oxide, U3O8) sometimes turned up in silver mines, and in 1789 Martin Heinrich Klaproth of Berlin investigated it. He dissolved it in nitric acid and precipitated a yellow compound when the solution was neutralised. He realised it was the oxide of a new element and tried to produce the metal itself by heating the precipitate with charcoal, but failed.

It fell to Eug√®ne Peligot in Paris to isolate the first sample of uranium metal which he did in 1841, by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Uranium is a very important element because it provides us with nuclear fuel used to generate electricity in nuclear power stations. It is also the major material from which other synthetic transuranium elements are made.

Naturally occurring uranium consists of 99% uranium-238 and 1% uranium-235. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring fissionable fuel (a fuel that can sustain a chain reaction). Uranium fuel used in nuclear reactors is enriched with uranium-235. The chain reaction is carefully controlled using neutron-absorbing materials. The heat generated by the fuel is used to create steam to turn turbines and generate electrical power.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Uranium occurs naturally in several minerals such as uranite (pitchblende), brannerite and carnotite. It is also found in phosphate rock and monazite sands. World production of uranium is about 41,000 tonnes per year.

Extracted uranium is converted to the purified oxide, known as yellow-cake. Uranium metal can be prepared by reducing uranium halides with Group 1 or Group 2 metals, or by reducing uranium oxides with calcium or aluminium.</p>
