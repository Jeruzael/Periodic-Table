			<h1>What is Protactinium?</h1>
			<p>Protactinium is a chemical element with the symbol Pa and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray actinide metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>Mendeleev said there should be an element between thorium and uranium, but it evaded detection. Then, in 1900, William Crookes separated an intensely radioactive material from uranium, but did not identify it. In 1913, Kasimir Fajans and Otto GÃ¶hring showed that this new element decayed by beta-emission and it existed only fleetingly. We now know it is a member of the sequence of elements through which uranium decays. It was the isotope protactinium-234, which has a half-life of 6 hours 42 minutes.

A longer-lived isotope was separated from the uranium ore pitchblende (uranium oxide, U3O8) in 1918 by Lise Meitner at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. This was the longer-lived isotope protactinium-231, also coming from uranium, and its half-life is 32,500 years.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Protactinium is little used outside of research. Protactinium has no known biological role. It is toxic due to its radioactivity.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="sec4">
            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Small amounts of protactinium are found naturally in uranium ores. It is also found in spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors, from which it is extracted.</p>
