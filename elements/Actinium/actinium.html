			<h1>What is Actinium?</h1>
			<p>Actinium is a chemical element with the symbol Ac and atomic number 89. It was first isolated by French chemist André-Louis Debierne in 1899. Friedrich Oskar Giesel later independently isolated it in 1902 and, unaware that it was already known, gave it the name emanium.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>This element was discovered in 1899 by André Debierne at Paris. He extracted it from the uranium ore pitchblende (uranium oxide, U3O8) in which it occurs in trace amounts. In 1902, Friedrich Otto Giesel independently extracted it from the same mineral and, unaware it was already known, gave it the named emanium.

Actinium extracted from uranium ores is the isotope actinium-227 which has half-life of 21.7 years. It occurs naturally as one of the sequence of isotopes that originate with the radioactive decay of uranium-235. A tonne of pitchblende contains around 150 mg of actinium.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Actinium has no known biological role. It is toxic due to its radioactivity. Actinium is a very powerful source of alpha rays, but is rarely used outside research.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Actinium used for research purposes is made by the neutron bombardment of radium-226. Actinium also occurs naturally in uranium ores.
