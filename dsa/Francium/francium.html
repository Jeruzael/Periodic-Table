			<h1>What is Francium?</h1>
			<p>Francium has been used in the field of research, chemistry and also in the atomic structure. It is used for diagnostics for curing cancers. It is also used in many spectroscopic experiments. Francium is a highly radioactive metal, and since it exhibits a short half-life, it does not have more impact on the environment.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>
Francium was finally discovered in 1939 by Marguerite Perey at the Curie Institute in Paris. She had purified a sample of actinium free of all its known radioactive impurities and yet its radioactivity still indicated another element was present, and which she rightly deduced was the missing element 87. Others challenged her results too, and it was not until after World War II that she was accepted as the rightful discoverer in 1946.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Francium has no known biological role. It is toxic due to its radioactivity. Francium has no uses, having a half life of only 22 minutes.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Francium is obtained by the neutron bombardment of radium in a nuclear reactor. It can also be made by bombarding thorium with protons.</p>
