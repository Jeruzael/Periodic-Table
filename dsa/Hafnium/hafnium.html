			<h1>What is Hafnium?</h1>
			<p>Hafnium is a chemical element with the symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in many zirconium minerals.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>In 1911, Georges Urbain reported the discovery of the missing element below zirconium in the periodic table, but he was wrong and the search continued. It was finally discovered by George Charles de Hevesy and Dirk Coster at the University of Copenhagen in 1923. It was found in a zirconium mineral, a Norwegian zircon, but it had proved very difficult to separate it from zirconium and this explained why hafnium remained undiscovered for so long.

Other zirconium minerals were now examined by Hevesy, and some were found to contain as much as five per cent of hafnium. </p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Hafnium is a good absorber of neutrons and is used to make control rods, such as those found in nuclear submarines. It also has a very high melting point and because of this is used in plasma welding torches.

Hafnium has been successfully alloyed with several metals including iron, titanium and niobium.

Hafnium oxide is used as an electrical insulator in microchips, while hafnium catalysts have been used in polymerisation reactions.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>Most zirconium ores contain around 5% hafnium. The metal can be prepared by reducing hafnium tetrachloride with sodium or magnesium.</p>
