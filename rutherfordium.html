			<h1>What is Rutherfordium?</h1>
			<p>rutherfordium is made within the lab, there are not very many uses for this element commercially. On the other hand, rutherfordium has been used within the laboratory setting to conduct research. Most elements that are highly radioactive are used for nuclear power and medicinal purposes.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
			<p>In 1964, a team led by Georgy Flerov at the Russian Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, bombarded plutonium with neon and produced element 104, isotope 259. They confirmed their findings in 1966.

In 1969, a team led by Albert Ghiorso at the Californian Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) made three successful attempts to produce element 104: by bombarding curium with oxygen to get isotope-260, californium with carbon to get isotope-257, and californium with carbon to get isotope-258.

A dispute over priority of discovery followed and eventually, in 1992, the International Unions of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) concluded that both the Russian and American researchers had been justified in making their claims. IUPAC decided element 104 would be called rutherfordium.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
            <p>Rutherfordium has no known biological role. At present, it is only used in research.</p>

            <h1>Natural abundance</h1>
            <p>utherfordium is a transuranium element. It is created by bombarding californium-249 with carbon-12 nuclei.</p>
