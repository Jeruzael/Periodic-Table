			<h1>What is Livermorium?</h1>
			<p>Livermorium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Lv and has an atomic number of 116. It is an extremely radioactive element that has only been created in the laboratory and has not been observed in nature. The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>Four isotopes of this element have been produced and they have mass numbers 290-293. The longest-lived is 293 with a half-life of 61 milliseconds.

			There were several attempts to make element 116 but all were unsuccessful until 2000 when researchers at the Joint International Nuclear Research (JINR) in Russia, led by Yuri Oganessian, Vladimir Utyonkov, and Kenton Moody observed it. Because the discovery was made using essential target material supplied by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in the USA, it was decided to name it after that facility.

			In1999, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California had announced the discovery of element 116 but then it was discovered that evidence had simply been concocted by one of their scientists, and so the claim had to be withdrawn.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>It has no known biological role..</p>

		<div id="sec4">
			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Livermorium does not occur naturally. It is made by bombarding curium atoms with calcium. The most stable isotope has a half-life of about 53 milliseconds.</p>
