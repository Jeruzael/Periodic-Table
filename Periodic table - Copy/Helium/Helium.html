			<h1>What is Helium?</h1>
			<p>Helium is the chemical element with the symbol He and atomic number 2. With a standard atomic weight of 4.003, Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe. it is uneconomical to extract helium from the air. The major source is natural gas, which can contain up to 7% helium</p>

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>In 1868, Pierre J. C. Janssen travelled to India to measure the solar spectrum during a total eclipse and observed a new yellow line which indicated a new element. Joseph Norman Lockyer recorded the same line by observing the sun through London smog and, assuming the new element to be a metal, he named it helium.

			In 1882, the Italian Luigi Palmieri found the same line the spectrum of gases emitted by Vesuvius, as did the American William Hillebrand in 1889 when he collected the gas given off by the mineral uraninite (UO2) as it dissolves in acid. However, it was Per Teodor Cleve and Nils Abraham Langer at Uppsala, Sweden, in 1895, who repeated that experiment and confirmed it was helium and measured its atomic weight.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p> Helium has no known biological role. It is non-toxic.</p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>After hydrogen, helium is the second most abundant element in the universe. It is present in all stars. It was, and is still being, formed from alpha-particle decay of radioactive elements in the Earth. Some of the helium formed escapes into the atmosphere, which contains about 5 parts per million by volume. This is a dynamic balance, with the low-density helium continually escaping to outer space.

			It is uneconomical to extract helium from the air. The major source is natural gas, which can contain up to 7% helium.</p>
