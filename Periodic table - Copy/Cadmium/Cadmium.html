			<h1>What is Cadmium?</h1>
			<p>Cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11. Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate.

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>In the early 1800s, the apothecaries of Hanover, Germany, made zinc oxide by heating a naturally occurring form of zinc carbonate called cadmia. Sometimes the product was discoloured instead of being pure white, and when Friedrich Stromeyer of GÃ¶ttingen University looked into the problem he traced the discoloration to a component he could not identify, and which he deduced must be an unknown element. This he separated as its brown oxide and, by heating it with lampblack (carbon), he produced a sample of a blue-grey metal which he named cadmium after the name for the mineral. That was in 1817. Meanwhile two other Germans, Karl Meissner in Halle, and Karl Karsten in Berlin, were working on the same problem and announced their discovery of cadmium the following year.

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Cadmium is toxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic (disturbs the development of an embryo or foetus). On average we take in as little as 0.05 milligrams per day. But it accumulates in the body, and so on average we store about 50 milligrams.

			Before the dangers of cadmium were fully understood, welders and other metal workers were at risk of becoming ill. In 1966 some welders working on the Severn Road Bridge became ill from breathing in cadmium fumes.</p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>The only mineral containing significant quantities of cadmium is greenockite (cadmium sulfide). It is also present in small amounts in sphalerite. Almost all commercially produced cadmium is obtained as a by-product of zinc refining.
