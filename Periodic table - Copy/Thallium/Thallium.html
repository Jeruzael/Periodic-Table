			<h1>What is Thallium?</h1>
			<p>Thallium is a chemical element with the symbol Tl and atomic number 81. It is a gray post-transition metal that is not found free in nature. When isolated, thallium resembles tin, but discolors when exposed to air. Chemists William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861, in residues of sulfuric acid production. Both used the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy, in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line. Thallium, from Greek θαλλός, thallós, meaning "a green shoot or twig", was named by Crookes

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>The discovery of thallium was controversial. William Crookes of the Royal College of Science in London was the first to observe a green line in the spectrum of some impure sulfuric acid, and realised that it meant a new element. He announced his discovery in March 1861 in Chemical News. However, he did very little research into it.

			Meanwhile, in 1862, Claude-August Lamy of Lille, France, began to research thallium more thoroughly and even cast a small ingot of the metal itself. The French Academy now credited him its discovery. He sent the ingot to the London International Exhibition of 1862, where it was acclaimed as a new metal and he was awarded a medal. Crookes was furious and so the exhibition committee awarded him a medal as well..</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Thallium has no known biological role. It is very toxic and there is evidence that the vapour is both teratogenic (disturbs the development of an embryo or foetus) and carcinogenic. It can displace potassium around the body affecting the central nervous system.</p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Thallium is found in several ores. One of these is pyrites, which is used to produce sulfuric acid. Some thallium is obtained from pyrites, but it is mainly obtained as a by-product of copper, zinc and lead refining.

			Thallium is also present in manganese nodules found on the ocean floor.
