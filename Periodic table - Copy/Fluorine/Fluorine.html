			<h1>What is Flourine?</h1>
			<p>Fluorine is a chemical element with the symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative element, it is extremely reactive, as it reacts with all other elements, except for argon, neon, and helium.</p>

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>The early chemists were aware that metal fluorides contained an unidentified element similar to chlorine, but they could not isolate it. (The French scientist, André Ampère coined the name fluorine in 1812.) Even the great Humphry Davy was unable to produce the element, and he became ill by trying to isolate it from hydrofluoric acid.

			The British chemist George Gore in 1869 passed an electric current through liquid HF but found that the gas which was liberated reacted violently with his apparatus. He thought it was fluorine but was unable to collect it and prove it. Then in 1886 the French chemist Henri Moissan obtained it by the electrolysis of potassium bifluoride (KHF2) dissolved in liquid HF.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p> Fluoride is an essential ion for animals, strengthening teeth and bones. It is added to drinking water in some areas. The presence of fluorides below 2 parts per million in drinking water is believed to prevent dental cavities. However, above this concentration it may cause children’s tooth enamel to become mottled. Fluoride is also added to toothpaste.

			The average human body contains about 3 milligrams of fluoride. Too much fluoride is toxic. Elemental fluorine is highly toxic.</p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>The most common fluorine minerals are fluorite, fluorspar and cryolite, but it is also rather widely distributed in other minerals. It is the 13th most common element in the Earth’s crust.

			Fluorine is made by the electrolysis of a solution of potassium hydrogendifluoride (KHF2) in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid.</p>
