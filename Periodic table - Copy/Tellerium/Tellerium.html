			<h1>What is Tellurium?</h1>
			<p>Tellurium is a chemical element with the symbol Te and atomic number 52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur, all three of which are chalcogens. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth, and partly to tellurium's low affinity for oxygen, which causes it to bind preferentially to other chalcophiles in dense minerals that sink into the core..

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>Tellurium was discovered in 1783 by Franz Joseph Müller von Reichenstein at Sibiu, Romania. He became intrigued by ore from a mine near Zalatna which had a metallic sheen and which he suspected was native antimony or bismuth. (It was actually gold telluride, AuTe2.) Preliminary investigation showed neither antimony nor bismuth to be present. For three years Müller researched the ore and proved it contained a new element. He published his findings in an obscure journal and it went largely unnoticed.

			In 1796, he sent a sample to Martin Klaproth in Berlin who confirmed him findings. Klaproth produced a pure sample and decided to call it tellurium. Rather strangely, this was not the first sample of tellurium to pass through his hands. In 1789, he had been sent some by a Hungarian scientist, Paul Kitaibel who had independently discovered it.

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Tellurium has no known biological role. It is very toxic and teratogenic (disturbs the development of an embryo or foetus). Workers exposed to very small quantities of tellurium in the air develop ‘tellurium breath’, which has a garlic-like odour.</p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Tellurium is present in the Earth’s crust only in about 0.001 parts per million. Tellurium minerals include calaverite, sylvanite and tellurite. It is also found uncombined in nature, but only very rarely. It is obtained commercially from the anode muds produced during the electrolytic refining of copper. These contain up to about 8% tellurium.
