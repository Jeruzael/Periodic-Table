			<h1>What is Tin?</h1>
			<p>Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue. Tin, like indium, is soft enough to be cut without much force.[7] When a bar of tin is bent, the so-called tin cry can be heard as a result of sliding tin crystals reforming; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, and frozen mercury. Pure tin after solidifying keeps a mirror-like appearance similar to most metals.

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>Tin had a direct impact on human history mainly on account of bronze, although it could be used in its own right, witness a tin ring and pilgrim bottle found in an Egyptian tomb of the eighteenth dynasty (1580–1350 BC). The Chinese were mining tin around 700 BC in the province of Yunnan. Pure tin has also been found at Machu Picchu, the mountain citadel of the Incas.

			When copper was alloyed with around 5 per cent of tin it produced bronze, which not only melted at a lower temperature, so making it easier to work, but produced a metal that was much harder, and ideal for tools and weapons. The Bronze Age is now a recognised stage in the development of civilisation. How bronze was discovered we do not know, but the peoples of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus valley started using it around 3000 BC.

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Tin has no known biological role in humans, although it may be essential to some species. The metal is non-toxic, but organo-tin compounds can be poisonous and must be handled with care. Plants easily absorb tin.</p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Tin is found principally in the ore cassiterite (tin(IV) oxide). It is mainly found in the ‘tin belt’ stretching through China, Thailand and Indonesia. It is also mined in Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. It is obtained commercially by reducing the ore with coal in a furnace.
