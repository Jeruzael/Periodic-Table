			<h1>What is Mercury?</h1>
			<p>Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum (/haɪˈdrɑːrdʒərəm/ hy-DRAR-jər-əm).A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the halogen bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature.

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>Cinnabar (aka vermilion, mercury sulfide, HgS), was used as a bright red pigment by the Palaeolithic painters of 30,000 years ago to decorate caves in Spain and France. Cinnabar would yield up its mercury simply on heating in a crucible, and the metal fascinated people because it was a liquid that would dissolve gold. The ancients used in on a large scale to extract alluvial gold from the sediment of rivers. The mercury dissolved the gold which could be reclaimed by distilling off the mercury.

			The Almadén deposit in Spain provided Europe with its mercury. In the Americas, it was the Spanish conquerors who exploited the large deposits of cinnabar at Huancavelica in order to extract gold. In 1848 the miners of the Californian Gold Rush used mercury from the New Almaden Mines of California.

			Although highly toxic, mercury had many uses, as in thermometers, but these are now strictly curtained.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Mercury has no known biological role, but is present in every living thing and widespread in the environment. Every mouthful of food we eat contains a little mercury.

			Our daily intake is less than 0.01 milligrams (about 0.3 grams in a lifetime), and this we can cope with easily. However, in much higher doses it is toxic and one form of mercury – methylmercury – is particularly dangerous. It can accumulate in the flesh of fish and be eaten by people, making them ill.</p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Mercury rarely occurs uncombined in nature, but can be found as droplets in cinnabar (mercury sulfide) ores. China and Kyrgyzstan are the main producers of mercury. The metal is obtained by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapour.
