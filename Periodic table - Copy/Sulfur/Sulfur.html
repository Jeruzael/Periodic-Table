			<h1>What is Sulfur?</h1>
			<p>Sulfur (in British English, sulphur) is a chemical element with the symbol S and atomic number 16. It is abundant, multivalent, and nonmetallic. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with a chemical formula S8. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow, crystalline solid at room temperature.

			Sulfur is the tenth most common element by mass in the universe, and the fifth most common on Earth. </p>

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>Sulfur is mentioned 15 times in the Bible, and was best known for destroying Sodom and Gomorrah. It was also known to the ancient Greeks, and burnt as a fumigant. Sulfur was mined near Mount Etna in Sicily and used for bleaching cloth and preserving wine, both of which involved burning it to form sulfur dioxide, and allowing this to be absorbed by wet clothes or the grape juice. For centuries, sulfur along with mercury and salt, was believed to be a component of all metals and formed the basis of alchemy whereby one metal could be transmuted into another.

			Antoine Lavoisier thought that sulfur was an element, but in 1808 Humphry Davy said it contained hydrogen. However, his sample was impure and when Louis-Josef Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Th√©nard proved it to be an element the following year, Davy eventually agreed.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Sulfur is essential to all living things. It is taken up as sulfate from the soil (or seawater) by plants and algae. It is used to make two of the essential amino acids needed to make proteins. It is also needed in some co-enzymes. The average human contains 140 grams and takes in about 1 gram a day, mainly in proteins.

			Sulfur and sulfate are non-toxic. However, carbon disulfide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide are all toxic. Hydrogen sulfide is particularly dangerous and can cause death by respiratory paralysis.

			Sulfur dioxide is produced when coal and unpurified oil are burned. Sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere causes acid rain. This can cause lakes to die, partly by making toxic aluminium salts soluble, so that they are taken up by living things.</p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Sulfur occurs naturally as the element, often in volcanic areas. This has traditionally been a major source for human use. It is also widely found in many minerals including iron pyrites, galena, gypsum and Epsom salts.

			Elemental sulfur was once commercially recovered from wells by the Frasch process. This involved forcing super-heated steam into the underground deposits to melt the sulfur, so it could be pumped to the surface as a liquid.

			Modern sulfur production is almost entirely from the various purification processes used to remove sulfur from natural gas, oil and tar sands. All living things contain sulfur and when fossilised (as in fossil fuels) the sulfur remains present. If unpurified fossil fuels are burnt, sulfur dioxide can enter the atmosphere, leading to acid rain.</p>
