			<h1>What is Neon?</h1>
			<p>Neon is a chemical element with the symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is a noble gas. Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air.</p>

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>In 1898, William Ramsay and Morris Travers at University College London isolated krypton gas by evaporating liquid argon. They had been expecting to find a lighter gas which would fit a niche above argon in the periodic table of the elements. They then repeated their experiment, this time allowing solid argon to evaporate slowly under reduced pressure and collected the gas which came off first. This time they were successful, and when they put a sample of the new gas into their atomic spectrometer it startled them by the brilliant red glow that we now associate with neon signs. Ramsay named the new gas neon, basing it on neos, the Greek word for new.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p> Neon has no known biological role. It is non-toxic. </p>

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Neon is the fifth most abundant element in the universe. However, it is present in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere at a concentration of just 18 parts per million. It is extracted by fractional distillation of liquid air. This gives a fraction that contains both helium and neon. The helium is removed from the mixture with activated charcoal.</p>
