			<h1>What is Holmium?</h1>
			<p>Erbium is a chemical element with the symbol Er and atomic number 68. A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements. It is a lanthanide, a rare earth element, originally found in the gadolinite mine in Ytterby in Sweden, from which it got its name.

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>In 1843, at Stockholm, Carl Mosander obtained two new metal oxides from yttrium, which had been know since 1794. One of these was erbium oxide, which was pink. (The other was terbium oxide, which was yellow.) While erbium was one of the first lanthanoid elements to be discovered, the picture is clouded because early samples of this element must have contained other rare-earths. We know this because In1878 Jean-Charles Galissard de Marignac, working at the University of Geneva, extracted another element from erbium and called it ytterbium. (This too was impure and scandium was extracted from it a year later.)

			A sample of pure erbium metal was not produced until 1934, when Wilhelm Klemm and Heinrich Bommer achieved it by heating purified erbium chloride with potassium.

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Erbium has no known biological role, and has low toxicity.</p>
			
		</div>
		<div id="sec4">
			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Erbium is found principally in the minerals monazite and bastnaesite. It can be extracted by ion exchange and solvent extraction</p>
