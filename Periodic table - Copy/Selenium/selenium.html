			<h1>What is Selenium?</h1>
			<p>Selenium is a chemical element with the symbol Se and atomic number 34. It is a nonmetal (more rarely considered a metalloid) with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the periodic table, sulfur and tellurium, and also has similarities to arsenic. It rarely occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth's crust. Selenium – from Ancient Greek σελήνη (selḗnē) "Moon" – was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered tellurium (named for the Earth).

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>Selenium was discovered by Jöns Jacob Berzelius at Stockholm in 1817. He had shares in a sulfuric acid works and he was intrigued by a red-brown sediment which collected at the bottom of the chambers in which the acid was made.

			At first he thought it was the element tellurium because it gave off a strong smell of radishes when heated, but he eventually realised that it was in fact a new element. He also noted that it was like sulfur and indeed had properties intermediate between sulfur and tellurium. Berzelius found that selenium was present in samples of tellurium and gave that element its characteristic smell. He also became affected by it personally – it can be absorbed through the skin – and it caused him to experience the bad breath associated with those who work with this element.

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Selenium is an essential trace element for some species, including humans. Our bodies contain about 14 milligrams, and every cell in a human body contains more than a million selenium atoms.

			Too little selenium can cause health problems, but too much is also dangerous. In excess it is carcinogenic and teratogenic (disturbs the development of an embryo or foetus).

			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Selenium is found in a few rare minerals. Most of the world’s selenium is obtained from the anode muds produced during the electrolytic refining of copper. These muds are either roasted with sodium carbonate or sulfuric acid, or smelted with sodium carbonate to release the selenium.
