			<h1>What is Radon?</h1>
			<p>Radon is a chemical element with the symbol Rn and atomic number 86. It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas. It occurs naturally in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains through which thorium and uranium slowly decay into lead and various other short-lived radioactive elements; radon itself is the immediate decay product of radium

			<h1>History</h1>
		    <p>In 1899, Ernest Rutherford and Robert B. Owens detected a radioactive gas being released by thorium. That same year, Pierre and Marie Curie detected a radioactive gas emanating from radium. In1900, Friedrich Ernst Dorn at Halle, Germany, noted that a gas was accumulating inside ampoules of radium. They were observing radon. That from radium was the longer-lived isotope radon-222 which has a half-life 3.8 days, and was the same isotope which the Curies has observed. The radon that Rutherford detected was radon-220 with a half-life of 56 seconds.

			In 1900, Rutherford devoted himself to investigating the new gas and showed that it was possible to condense it to a liquid. In 1908, William Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray at University College, London, collected enough radon to determine its properties and reported that it was the heaviest gas known.</p>

			<h1>Biological role</h1>
			<p>Radon has no known biological role. It is, however, thought that it may have had a significant role in evolution. This is because it is responsible for much of the Earth’s background radiation that can lead to genetic modifications.</p>
			
		</div>
		<div id="sec4">
			<h1>Natural abundance</h1>
			<p>Radon is produced naturally from the decay of the isotope radium-226, which is found in rocks. It was first discovered as a radioactive gas produced from radium as it decayed. There is a detectable amount in the Earth’s atmosphere.</div>
